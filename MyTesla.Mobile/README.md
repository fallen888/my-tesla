# MyTesla Android App
Receive reminders to plug in and charge your Tesla.

I have terrible memory and have forgotten to plug in my car to charge over night several times. Usually it's not a big deal at all (first-world problems), but it's still a minor annoyance. 
So I decided to create a mobile app to remind me to plug in to charge. 

Basically the app takes the following steps:
 * Check if it's time to charge (configured between monitoring start and end times)
 * Check if vehicle is at the designated charging location (configured within settings screen)
 * Check if vehicle is currently disconnected from charger
 * Push notification to device to remind user to plug in (based on configured frequency)

I found this site very handy for generating C# models based on JSON results, and recommend its use whenever JSON structure changes - http://json2csharp.com/

If you're interested in helping test the app or contributing to its development, please inquire via hello@kalilabs.com.
